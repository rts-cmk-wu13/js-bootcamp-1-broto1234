// The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1

// The Math.floor() method rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer. The Math.floor() static method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
//Math.floor(5.95) # 5;  Math.floor(5.05)  # 5;  Math.floor(5)   #5; Math.floor(-5.05)  # -6


// Example:
//  quotesList.length = 2
// Math.random() * quotesList.length = Math.random() * 2 = 0.4 * 2 = 0.8
// Math.floor(Math.random() * quotesList.length) = Math.floor(0.8) = 0

//  quotesList.length = 4
// Math.random() * quotesList.length = Math.random() * 4 = 0.6 * 4 = 2.4
// Math.floor(Math.random() * quotesList.length) = Math.floor(2.4) = 2
